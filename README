- Fetch "1480A USB Protocol Analyzer Software" from
  http://www.internationaltestinstruments.com/
  This creates, among other things, 2 files needed for the rest of this
  procedure:
    ITI1480A.spt
    ulpitest.rbf
- Install it
- Run
    sptreader.py /path/to/ITI1480A.spt
  This generates 2 files (as of v3.6 of ITI software)
- Run
    lsusb -d 16c0:07a8
  And use the bus and device adresses in following commands.
- As root, run
    cycfx2prog -d=<bus>.<device> prg:ITI1480A_1.hex run
  This loads the USB chip firmware into the USB analyser.
- As root, run
    rbfsend.py -f /path/to/ulpitest.rbf > out.usb
  This loads the FPGA initialisation file and starts dumping data sent by the
  analyzer.
  Kill it (ctrl-c) when you want to stop the capture.
