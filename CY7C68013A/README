Firmware for the Cypress FX2-LP chip on analyser board.

To build it, you need fx2lib[1] and its dependencies.
Download and build it, then put its path in your environement:
  export FX2LIBDIR=~/git/fx2lib/
  make

Result is in "build" directory. To load it once on a plugged & unconfigured
ITI1480A, there are two options. If you have fx2load:
  make load
If you have cycfx2prog:
  make load-cycfx2prog
